# File structures
## CGL
CGL contains a uncompressed CGL header followed by LZMA compressed "BLOB header" and finally individually LZMA compressed "Data sections" described in Data header.
## CGL Header
There are two known CGL Header structures one 52 bytes and other XXX bytes long. Meaning of every byte is not yet known, so headers existing in game files have to be used as a base when building new CGLs

### Example 52 byte CGL Header
![52 byte CGL Header](/docs/img/cglHeader52bytesDEM.png "52 byte CGL Header")

52 bytes long structure INCOMPLETE 20/52 bytes known:
|OFFSET|TYPE (BYTES)| DESCRIPTION
|------|------------|-----------
|`0x00`|DATA(5)| Magic bytes?
|`0x`|DWORD(4)|
|`0x20`|Uint16(2)?| Data section count
|`0x2C`|DWORD(4)| Data header start offset
|`0x28`|Uint24(3)| Data header length bytes
|`0x2C`|Uint32(4)| LZMA Dictionary size
|`0x30`|BYTE(1)| Data section LZMA lclppb "properties"
|`0x31`|BYTE(1)| Data header LZMA lclppb "properties"

## DEM BLOB Header
Data header contains a subquadkeys, compressed data length (delta compressed) and uncompressed data length (delta to compressed size for respective section) for every data section. It is compressed with with LZMA.

## DEM Data type
DEM data contains a series of images that form a laplacian image pyramid.

## DEM Data section 
---
DEM tile starts with 7 BYTES long header which is followed by raw elevation data.
### DEM Header:

| OFFSET      | TYPE (BYTES) | DESCRIPTION
| ----------- | ------------ | -----------
| `0x00`      | FP32 (4)      | Height scale
| `0x04`      | UInt16 (2)   | Negative height offset 
| `0x06`      | BYTE (1)     | **BITDEPTH**

### Example header:
> `00 00 80 40 FC FF 08`

`00 00 80 40` = 4 => every raw value is multiplied by 4.0 to get height in meters

`FC FF` = -4 => to each raw value is added (4.0*-4)\*(-1)=16 meters

`08` = 8 bits (1 BYTE) per pixel

### DEM Tile data
After header follows raw elevation data. Structure is a 2D array of 257 rows and 257 columns with **BITDEPTH** bits per value. Last row and column overlap first row and column of adjacent tiles
